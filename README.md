# My First Vulnerability Scan

<h2>Description</h2>
In this project, I decided to run a vulnerability scanner for the first time. I did this using Burp Suite, a collection of tools for web application security testing commonly used in businesses. This project covers intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy, modifying requests in Burp Proxy, setting the target scope, manually reissuing requests with Burp Repeater, and running my first vulnerability scan. 
<br />

<h2>Intercepting HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy:</h2>

Firstly, I downloaded the Community Edition of Burp Suite onto my PC and started it up.
In order to intercept HTTP traffic, I used Burp Proxy. Burp Proxy allows the user to intercept HTTP requests and responses between the Burp Browser and a target server.

I went to the Proxy tab at the top of the Burp Suite dashboard, made sure interception was turned on, and opened up a Burp Browser.

Inside the browser, I tried to visit “https://PortSwigger.net” and noticed that the site did not load. You can see from the screenshot below on the left is the Burp Browser, and on the right is the output I received after trying to visit the website. 

Burp Proxy has actually intercepted the HTTP request by the browser before it could reach the server and printed the request on Burp Proxy, which I can use to analyze and modify. After forwarding the request, I turned off interception mode.

With the Proxy tool, I was actually able to look at the HTTP history and see all the HTTP requests coming in while interception mode was turned off.

This allowed me to visit the website and have a visualization of the interaction between the browser and the server.

<h2>Modifying HTTP traffic with Burp Proxy:</h2>
In this part, I modified an intercepted request in Burp Proxy. This allowed me to change the request and see how the site responded. I did this by using some deliberately vulnerable websites. 

I opened the vulnerable site and logged in. The vulnerable site was a shopping site. I selected to view the product details for an item, turned on interception mode, and added the item to the cart.

From the screenshot below, you can see the output results of my adding the item to my cart. Notice how the last line in the Burp Proxy output mentions the item's price. 
(“price = 133700”)

From there, I modified the price of the item. Just by going into Burp Proxy, I clicked and replaced the number “133700” with “1” and forwarded the intercepted traffic.

What does this mean? This means that I was able to change the price of the item from $1337.00 to $0.01. The screenshot below shows the total cost for purchasing the item is $0.01.

<h2>Setting the Target Scope:</h2>
Next, I tested a target scope that allowed me to tell which URLs and hosts to test. This lets me filter out any noise created by the browser and only pay attention to the traffic I specified. 

I visited another vulnerable shopping site and explored the site by clicking on a few product pages to generate HTTP requests.

After generating some requests, I went to the Target Site map to view the different hosts and select the ones I wanted in my target scope. 

The hosts are on the left side of the screenshot. By right-clicking on them, I selected which ones I wanted to be in the target scope.

<br />
After that, I filtered out the HTTP history with hosts only from the target scope that I selected.

<br />

From there, I was only able to see requests coming in from specific hosts.

<h2>Re-issuing requests with Burp Repeater:</h2>
In this section, I used Burp Repeater to send requests repeatedly. This allowed me to study the response of a website to different requests without having to individually intercept each one. This tool makes it more effective in scanning for vulnerabilities. 

To send a request to Burp Repeater, I had to send one of the HTTP traffic to the repeater. 

After I selected the HTTP request to the repeater, I was able to resend the same request.

With this tool, I was able to change the raw data of the request. The screenshot below shows the raw data of the request. In the first line, I changed the product ID of the shopping item from “4” to “100”.

Not only that, I was also able to change the Product ID to a string of characters. I tried changing the product ID to “test”. But it returned an error.

This screenshot shows that the website is using the Apache Struts framework and even the version it is using.

In the real world, this is the type of information that helps attackers find vulnerabilities to breach a system.
